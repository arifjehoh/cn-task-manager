# Cloud-Native Task Manager
A task manager app where users can create, assign, and track task with deadlines. It starts as a monolithic application and evolves into a cloud-native microservice architecture following the roadmap created with ChatGPT.

## Project Scope

3. User Management

9. Search and Filters
   - Search tasks by keywords, assignees, or deadlines.
   - Apply filters like priority, status, or category.

## Phases and Migration Plan
1. Phase 1: Monolithic Architecture
2. Phase 2: Containerization
3. Phase 3: Decouple into Services
4. Phase 4: Add Observability and Scalability
5. Phase 5: Fully Cloud-Native with CNCF Tools, [Cloud-Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)
